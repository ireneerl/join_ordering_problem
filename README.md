# join_ordering_problem - JOP
join ordering problem_
The goal of this project is to have a clean Join Ordering Problem build, with specs:

C++ version: C++11 
Build system: qmake
C++ compiler: g++
Libraries: STL only
Code coverage: gcov (note: it should show the code coverage is below 100%)
Source: multiple files

Algorithms:
1. Brute Force
2. Dynamic Algorithm
3. Greedy Algorithm -> GOO
4. Genetic Algorithm
5. Simulated Annealing

--> initial experiment uses sample case table for join ordering that is listerd on the literature:
